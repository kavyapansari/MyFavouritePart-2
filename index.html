            My favourite character's name is Doremon. He is a cat robot from the 22nd century. Even though he is a cat robot , he is scared of mice! He enters from a study table drawer in the 21st century in Nobita's house. He had been sent there by a time machine to make Nobita happy . Nobita was a lazy boy who never did his homework, was always late for school and was bullied by his classmate Gian. Doremon had a magical pocket attached to his stomach in which there were all sorts of gadgets like small light, big light, anywhere door, etc. The most useful one was the take-copter. You had to put it on your head and you could fly anywhere.Doremon also had a sister named Dorami. She was always helpful and caring towards Doremon. Doremon also cared deeply about his sister and could not see her in pain. Over time, Doremon became very attached to Nobita and his family and decided to stay there forever.
